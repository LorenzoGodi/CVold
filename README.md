# About Me

I am a computer scientist and an astronomy student. My pursuit in life has always been knowledge. I was just six years old when I was captivated in front of the screen by a documentary about black holes. I appreciate and need to constantly deepen my understanding of the world. Computer sciences have always been my strong suit since high school. I enjoy designing software and programming. You will find in me an highly motivated person, willing to learn and face challenges and capable of working independently. I also enjoy collaborating in a team environment and exchanging ideas. I would love to dedicate myself to a stimulating project, growing my abilities and passion.
